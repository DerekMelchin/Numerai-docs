## Motivation

Long term performance is key.

## Calculation

Your reputation for any given metric on any given day is simply the average of that metric over the past year using only resolved rounds.

Late and missing submissions in the 1 year window are given a score of 0. To avoid this penalty, automate your weekly submission workflow with [Numerai Compute](https://docs.numer.ai/tournament/compute).
