# Rounds

## Round Lifecycle

At a high level, each round goes through 4 stages over the span of a month:

* Open: when new live features are released
* Close: when live predictions must be submitted
* Score: when live submission scores are computed
* Resolve: when the final score and payouts are resolved

The tournament is organized into rounds starting Saturday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday every week.&#x20;

With each round spanning one month and 5 new rounds starting each week, we end up with an overlapping round schedule. At any given time, we can have up to 25 overlapping resolving rounds.  &#x20;

Here is a visualization of the schedule of tournament rounds.

## Round Schedule

We generally we expect rounds to follow this schedule:

| Round   | Open          | Close         |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Sat-Mon | Sat 18:00 UTC | Mon 14:30 UTC |
| Tue     | Tue 13:00 UTC | Tue 14:00 UTC |
| Wed     | Wed 13:00 UTC | Tue 14:00 UTC |
| Thu     | Thu 13:00 UTC | Thu 14:00 UTC |
| Fri     | Fri 13:00 UTC | Fri 14:00 UTC |

Actual open and close times may vary from round to round, but we will always maintain a minimum 1 hour submission window.
